# NWSL_Player_Stats

In this assignment, I analyzed NWSL Women's Soccoer player stats such as the distribution of ages and analyzed the minutes played vs goals scored. I got data from three teams from  https://fbref.com/en/ and scraped it into an excel file, which I used as my datasets.

In order to reproduce my results, one must make sure to run the first two lines of code to import ggplot2 and readxl. If these lines do not work make sure to install the packages and then run them again.

You can reproduce the rest of the results by simply running the rest of the code, which will give you my exact results of the histogram and the scatter plot.
